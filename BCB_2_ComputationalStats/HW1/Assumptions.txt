Assumptions.txt is a list of assumptions or other notes that are relevant for the homework questions.

Overall Assumptions:

1. We assume whole genome or targeted resequencing has been undertaken of a random sample
of individuals from a well-defined population.

2. We assume the genome of the organism has been previously
sequenced, and that the reads have been successfully aligned to a good reference genome.

3. We assume sequencing errors at sites within the reads are independent.

4. We assume reads are independent conditional on the true source sequence

5. We assume a sample of size n individuals.

	A. We focus on a particular site in the genome where there is read coverage from the sequencing data. 
	B. For the ith individual, the ploidy level is mi.
	C. The (unknown) genotype Gi ∈ {0, 1, 2, . . . , mi} is the number of reference nucleotide.
	D. The sequence data are Di = (Di1, Di2, . . . , Dili).
	E. The quality scores are Qi = (Qi1, Qi2, . . . , Qili).
		E1. li is the coverage (number of sequences aligned) to the chosen genomic position. 


Throughout this problem, we will condition on the quality scores.


Assumptions/Notes on Question 1:

We focus on the ith individual and drop the subscript i in the notation.

Likelihood of observing k reference alleles and l − k alleles not
equal to the reference.

Zj = 1 {Dj = br}, where br is the reference allele, indicate if the jth observed read matches the reference allele.

The likelihood of the data Z1, Z2, . . . , Zl given the genotype g, when there are Σ l j=1 Zj = k reference alleles. WLOG, reorder the data so the first k reads match the reference allele.

1a Assumptions:
We assume a biallelic SNP.
We will condition on the quality scores.

1b Assumptions:
We assume that at sites 962 and 964 assuming the reference base in both cases is nb = A

1c Assumptions:
We assume that reads do not depend on genotype.
We assume that an allele is a SNP with a frequency-prior of 0.5 P(G=g)=0.5.
	Assume prior population is 0.5, assume a 50/50 match.

1d Assumptions:

1e assumptions:




Assumptions/Notes on Question 2:

The full dataset contains reads from three individuals. 
Test all sites for evidence of variation (a possible SNP).

Assume/given only three individuals and thus very little information about ψ.

Use the mutant calling method to test the hypothesis that the number of reference alleles in each of these three individuals at each of these sites is 2.

All individuals i ∈ {0, 1, 2}.
Sites s ∈ {764, 765, . . . , 1199}.


Assume all (individual) i's have the same same (ploidy) m.

(Remember that in mutant calling Ho: G = m).

2a Assumptions:

We assume zisjb (ind.) ∼ Bernoulli(1 − eisj) and eisj is the probability of error of the sth nucleotide in the jth read of the ith individual.

2b Assumptions:

2c Assumptions:




Assumptions/Notes on Question 3:

Assumptions about the meaning of the NGS quality scores. 

SNP genotyping notes assumes
	1. The probability of error is independent of the true base.
        2. Each possible error is equally likely when an error has occurred.
        3. The quality score can be taken literally.

Pr(R = b | B = b, Q = q) = 1 − 10^(−q/10)
Pr(R = b'| B = b, Q = q) = 1/3(10^(−q/10))

For all b ∈ {A, C, G, T} and b' neq b.

Test the validity of these three assumptions.

Using shorthand notation: pqbb' := Pr(R = b'| B = b, Q = q)

Maximum likelihood estimation is analytically possible for all parts of this question, though of course you will have to use a computer to compute the value of the formula.

3a Assumptions:

Generally, we cannot observe the true base B that produced read nucleotide R, but for those sites where you are confident the individual is homozygous, we can be very confident that we know the true base. 
	Notice for heterozygous positions, we cannot.

3b Assumptions:

3c Assumptions:
